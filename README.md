## About the project
- The project was done as part of an assignment during my Object oriented programming course.
- I really enjoyed working with Windows Forms and being able to implement my code using good practice and OOP principles. 

### Short description
- In short the game is just a basic snake where you collect food to grow the size and score of your snake unit.
- The challenge for me was learning to adapt to a new syntax and language whilst trying to keep in mind that my implementation needed to obide by rules of SOLID and GRASP.
- I take with me a deepened understanding of classes and project design in general, alot more effort went into actually planning and structuring rather than trying to achieve a good looking game.
